In order to wrap a given code, we can think of it as a machine that takes input and produces output. Thus, our wrapper should be able to execute the code and provide the desired output based on user inputs and parameters. This can be accomplished with the following code:

```python
TC = TheCode()
output = TC.run(input=input, params=params)
```

However, some code may take a long time to execute, so we can split it into a `Runner` and `Parser` to make it more efficient. This would look like:

```python
R = Runner()
R.run(input=input, params=params, database=database)

P = Parser()
output = P.extract(input=input, params=params, database=database)
```

The specific implementation of `Runner` and `Parser` will depend on the specific requirements of the code being wrapped. The `Runner` will need to execute the code and prepare the output in a usable format for the `Parser` to extract. The `Parser` will then take this output and format it correctly for the serving code.

For example, if the code being wrapped is a machine learning model that processes images and produces a classification result, the `Runner` may need to perform image preprocessing and model inference while the `Parser` may need to extract the classification output from the results of the `Runner`.

On the other hand, if the code being wrapped is a database query that returns data based on certain input parameters, the `Runner` may need to execute the query and return the data, while the `Parser` may have to extract the required fields from each record and format them accordingly.

If the code being wrapped is a simulator that runs a physics simulation based on user inputs, the `Runner` may need to take in user inputs, use them to run the simulation, and return the simulation results. The `Parser` may then extract relevant data from the simulation output, such as object positions or velocities, to be used by the wrapping code.
